# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp about Functional Programming.

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying the topic about Functional Programming,
due to realization that a global notion of a good practice, 
can lead to good coding.


### Day 2: August 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, finnished Functional Programming and started 
Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts** It's a good feeling when we are able to finish
the exercises.
