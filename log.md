# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp about Functional Programming.

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying the topic about Functional Programming,
due to realization that a global notion of a good practice, 
can lead to good coding.


### Day 2: August 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, finnished Functional Programming and started 
Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts** It's a good feeling when we are able to finish
the exercises.

### Day 3: August 14, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've continued doing Intermediate Algorithm Scripting exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Learned about `arguments` object (I needed to understand in order to
successfully finnish the exercise), but strugled with the second exercise (still
need to finish it).

### Day 4: August 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I decided to create a GitHub repository for some 
exercises of FreeCodeCamp, so I took some time creating the structure, while
learning more about git commands.

**Thoughts** I decided to create the repository in a Markdown fashion way, to allow
my thoughts, and what I need to improve and compare with solutions found 
on FreeCodeCamp.
